        <h2> Backstage: A Newsletter for the Inner World of Ballet
        </h2> 
        
        <p class="description"> From my deep and personal history with ballet, this project was close to my heart. In this newsletter are six individual stories pulled from various publications across the web and redesigned into an interactive and captivating project. 

        In this endeavor, I embraced the challenge of not just conveying information but also displaying that information in a unique and interesting way. This newsletter is more than a communication tool; it's a visual storytelling project.
