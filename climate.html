        <h2> Exploring Climate Change Education  in New York City
        </h2> 
        <p class="description">  From conceptualization to execution, every pixel was a product of my passion for design & climate change education. In this project, I combined my journalism skills  with my love and passion for design resulting in a visually aesthetic and informative pamphlet. 
        This graphic explores the central themes and buzzwords of climate change education in New York City. It's a piece of an in depth analysis of New York City’s education system and how it’s tackling the climate crisis. The pamphlet below features interviews with two elementary school teachers, Lauren Paull and Brandon Glasgow, as well as climate change resilience leader and changemaker, Emily Fano. All three of these individuals approach climate change differently, but one sentiment remains the same: the youth are the future & and education is the name of the game.
