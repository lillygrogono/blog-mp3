            </h2>

             Red, chipped benches encircle the Jacob Riis cul-de-sac, echoing stories of discouraged tenants. Outside building 466, residents Robert Diaz, Antonio Rios, and Mando Martinez sit together in conversation. A month after the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) released contradictory statements about unsafe drinking water, distrust is still the prevailing sentiment. As Rios says, “you can never trust these people.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Water testing, community Zooms, and looming lawsuits continue at Jacob Riis after arsenic was initially detected in the water supply. NYCHA’s unclear communication about the test results are driving tenants to advocate for answers, consideration, and above all, truth. 
            </p>
            <p>
            “This one was the icebreaker,” says lifelong resident of Jacob Riis, Jose Campos, in response to the recent arsenic scare. The lack of transparency from NYCHA has made it difficult for tenants to grasp the full extent of the situation, leading Campos to lose confidence in their authority.

            <p>
            Although complaints of murky brown water surfaced in early August, tenants didn’t receive a formal response until September 2, when arsenic was reportedly detected in the water supply. After residents endured seven days of panic, disquiet, and anger, the official lab results were retracted by Environmental Monitoring and Technology (EMT), a private testing company contracted by NYCHA. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Dave Brasuell, Jacob Riis tenant and community leader of 68 years, was infuriated when informed of the unsafe drinking water. Brasuell alluded to the lack of agency NYCHA has toward its tenants’ safety and is no stranger to pressuring NYCHA when it comes to standard repairs and inquires, “if you talk to the right people, you get results.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Confusion among the Jacob Riis community persisted as Greg Russ, CEO of NYCHA, stepped down only days after the September response was issued. Interim CEO Lisa Bova-Hiatt took his position while Russ moved to Chairman of the Board. In a few short statements released by Russ, he confirmed that he will, “remain a resource and partner to Lisa, the NYCHA team, NYCHA residents and the city.” 
            </p>
            <p>
            Unfortunately, this sentiment proved hollow. At a press conference in September, with Council Members Gale Brewer, Chair of the Oversight and Investigation Committee, Alexa Avilés, Chair of the Public Housing Committee, and Carlina Rivera from District 2, Greg Russ did not make an appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
            “It’s a very poor decision,” said Councilwoman Alexa Avilés referring to Greg Russ’ noticeable absence. She indicated that Russ’ silence validated Jacob Riis residents’ anger and the perceived avoidance of accountability. Gale Brewer added: “this arsenic situation inspires little faith in the Housing Authority.”
            </p>
            <p>
            Daphne Williams, Tenant President of the Jacob Riis buildings, spoke during the press conference about the apathy and neglect residents continue to feel from NYCHA. “We’re not comfortable…and we won’t be comfortable for a long time,” she said.
            </p>
            <p>
            A brief history of the water and plumbing infrastructure at Jacob Riis provides context and perspective on the current challenges. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Water makes its way to the public housing community by traveling 125 miles downstream from Catskill, New York. Low-rise buildings gather their water supply from standard pressure pipes, while buildings higher than six floors require booster pumps. Booster pumps propel the water up to the roof, where a water tank smoothly disperses water throughout the building.
            </p>
            <p>
            At Jacob Riis, there are two such buildings with booster pumps– buildings 465 and 466. In a recent Zoom meeting with Daniel Green, Senior Vice President for Healthy Homes at NYCHA, he explained that one of the essential pumps for building 466 was under maintenance at the time the cloudy water complaints began. While there is no evidence that proves or disproves this caused the water cloudiness, Green and the rest of NYCHA are hypothesizing this was the case. 
            </p>
            <p>
            As for who’s to blame for the arsenic scare, the lines remain blurred.
            </p>
            <p>
            Currently, there are three main players: NYCHA, Liquitech, and EMT. Liquitech is a water management and testing company that had been a trusted NYCHA contractor since 2019. During the time of water complaints, however, Liquitech had subcontracted water testing to EMT, a private Illinois-based business. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Herein lies the point of confusion. EMT is not certified to test water in New York given its out of state location. Further, their tests were improperly conducted leading to a false-positive reading of arsenic in the water. It is still unclear why Liquitech contracted EMT, and in doing so broke the terms of its contract with NYCHA. 
            </p>
            <P>
            Since this issue has come to light, NYCHA has contracted with a new firm which has conducted 200 water tests. The organization has committed to testing twice a month through the end of the year. The main goal right now is to be as transparent as possible and post the results publicly on NYCHA’s website. 
            </P>
            <p>
            “It’s tough, I’m very cautious when I drink the water now,” says Jose Campos, when asked about his confidence in NYCHA. Even after the water passed safety clearances, many residents were apprehensive to begin using the supply again for daily needs– bathing, cooking, and drinking. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In fact, a few tenants are taking matters into their own hands. Carlos Viner, 75, a Vietnam Veteran and tenant of Jacob Riis for 35 years, decided to schedule a doctor’s appointment along with his wife. He states his test results showed unusually high levels of arsenic, leading him to pursue legal action against NYCHA.
            </p>
            <p>
            Viner has openly criticized NYCHA’s handling of the situation and lack of support for tenant health testing, “There’s no reason why we should go to our private doctors with NYCHA’s problems.”
            </p>
            <p>
            While NYCHA and the City Council work feverishly to repair their image and relationship with tenants at Jacob Riis, there is at least one class-action lawsuit pending. Attorney Samuel A. Rubenstein has already signed up 35 tenants, including Viner, and is currently drafting a legal brief seeking damages for both fear of illness and illness itself. It remains to be seen whether the tenants will get their day in court. 
            </p>
            <p>
            NYCHA has had many challenges over the years, but the recent arsenic scare has pushed many residents past their breaking point. At the press conference Williams made her final point, “it seemed like they didn’t really care about the residents of the Jacob Riis houses.”
